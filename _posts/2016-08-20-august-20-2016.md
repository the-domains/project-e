Have decided to keep a sort of diary on how this project of the "grid" website is going. I became a founding member about a year ago. Proud member \#58374 üòâ

Truth is, I still don't quite understand how am I going to design this site...or these sites...

I think more tutorials and more accessibility is needed... However, we're on Beta version - so look forward to the lunch.
